Assignment: Functions assembly

About:
functions.asm is an anssembly file that uses 4 different functions to determine the radius of
a circle with radius 10. In the main function it calls circle prints the raduis and then run 
area which will print out the area after detemrining it and then circumfrence which will do the
same but with the circumfrence.

Learned:
From this assignment I learned about how to navigate functions within assembly and a few
interesting things about how assembly functions work. For example not returning your
assembly function will run the code that is below it. I've also learned how to work with 
xmm registers when working with floats.

Output:
the circle has a radius of 10.000000
the circumference is 62.831800
The area is 314.159000
